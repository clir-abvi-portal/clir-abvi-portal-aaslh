Donated to the museum by Mrs. Sylvester B. Howell following the death of her husband, manager of the Howell Printing Company in Waterloo, in 1971.


Emancipation Day was an American holiday celebrated by Blacks in commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the British West Indies on 1 August 1834. The first Emancipation Day celebration in Iowa was held in Muscatine in 1857. The holiday came to Waterloo in the 1910s, following significant black migration to the city. The NAACP negotiated annually with the ownership of Electric Park, an amusement park adjacent to the National Dairy Cattle Congress grounds, to reserve the park for an entire day. In addition to the regularly-offered amusement park entertainment, there was usually a parade, speakers, and dancing at the Electric Park Ballroom. Emancipation Day has been largely replaced by Juneteenth in Waterloo.",2 pages,posters,,,,,,Iowa--Waterloo
